# End-to-End-NLP-project-with-Hugging-face-and-Transformers
This is my second end to end project with respect to ML and NLP. Implemented step by step heuristically and documented each steps and notes within docs


# Objective
- To understand and implement the ML and NLP project step by step heuristically.
- To create a simple text summarization.
- Documenting each step with its difficulty and nuances.

# Implementation

## What is hugging face and why is it essentional?
- In my understanding, Hugging face is a platform where the models, datasets, documentation of different transformers are available.
- These resources are open, thus can be practioned by any personal, thus it is essential for every machine learning practioner.


## step-1: uv installation
- `pip install uv`
- `uv init --python 3.11`
- `uv sync`
- For installation of packages and grouping them together
    ```
    uv add --group groupName\
        pandas\
        numpy\
        matplotlib
    ```
- We can categorize them with group name.

## step-2: Create template.py
- Objective: To create the project folder structure automatically
- Create `template.py`
