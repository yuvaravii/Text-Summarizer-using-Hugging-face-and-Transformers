# End-to-End-NLP-project-with-Hugging-face-and-Transformers
This is my second end to end project with respect to ML and NLP. Implemented step by step heuristically and documented each steps and notes within docs


# Objective
- To understand and implement the ML and NLP project step by step heuristically.
- To create a simple text summarization.
- Documenting each step with its difficulty and nuances.

# Implementation

## What is hugging face and why is it essentional?
- In my understanding, Hugging face is a platform where the models, datasets, documentation of different transformers are available.
- These resources are open, thus can be practioned by any personal, thus it is essential for every machine learning practioner.
